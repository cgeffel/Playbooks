From the Hacker Public Radio Episode <a href="https://hackerpublicradio.org/eps.php?id=2356">hpr2356 :: Safely enabling ssh in the default Raspbian Image" hosted by Ken Fallon CC-BY-SA</a> 
</p>

<p>In this post I will show you how to take a default Raspbian Image and safely enable ssh by allowing remote access only with authorized keys.</p>
<p>Recently, and correctly, the official Rasbian Pixel distribution disabled ssh with the note that  <em>from now on SSH will be disabled by default on our images. </em>To understand why this is a good thing please read <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/a-security-update-for-raspbian-pixel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A security update for raspbian pixel</a>. In short, having 11 million computers out there in the hands of non security professionals, with a known username and password, is not a good idea.</p>
<p>That said there are many cases where you want to access your Pi remotely, and a key part of that is the ability to access it securely via ssh.</p>
<p>The Raspberry Pi site offers a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/">solution</a> for how to reactivate ssh. One option is via the GUI, <em>Preferences</em> &gt; <em>Interfaces</em>&gt; <em>SSH</em> &gt; <em>Enabled</em>. Another is via the console <em>sudo raspi-config</em> &gt; <em>Interfacing Options </em>&gt; <em>SSH</em> &gt; <em>Yes &gt; Ok &gt; Finish</em>. The third offers a more interesting option.</p>
<blockquote><p>For headless setup, SSH can be enabled by placing a file named ssh, without any extension, onto the boot partition of the SD card. When the Pi boots, it looks for the ssh file. If it is found, SSH is enabled, and the file is deleted. The content of the file does not matter: it could contain text, or nothing at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what we want. Normally you would burn the image, then boot it in a Pi with a keyboard, screen and mouse attached, and then add the file. A shortcut to that would be to burn the image, eject it, insert it again, mount the sdcard boot partition, and then create a file called <em>ssh</em>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like either of these solutions as they involve varying amounts of user intervention. I want a solution that will automatically leave me with a modified image at the end without any intervention (aka human error) on my part.</p>
<p>So I want to build a script that can handle the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest image zip file</li>
<li>Verify it is valid</li>
<li>Extract the image itself</li>
<li>Enable ssh</li>
<li>Change the default passwords for the root and pi user</li>
<li>Secure the ssh server on the Pi</li>
</ul>
<p>I could add to this list and customize every aspect of the image, but my experience has shown that the more you modify, the more maintenance you will need to do. When changes are made to the base Rasbian image, you will need to fix your scripts, and worse is the job of updating all those already deployed Pi&#8217;s.</p>
<p>A better approach is to use the base images and control them with automation tools like <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, <a href="https://www.chef.io/chef/">chef</a>, <a href="https://puppet.com">puppet</a>, <a href="https://cfengine.com/">cfengine</a>, etc. This allows the images to be treated as Cattle rather than Pets, to see what that means see <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/randybias/architectures-for-open-and-scalable-clouds">Architectures for open and scalable clouds</a>, by Randy Bias, VP Technology at EMC, Director at OpenStack Foundation.</p>
<p>Another approach to consider would be to <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/net_tutorial.md">Network Boot</a> your Raspberry Pi and in that way the sdcard is barely used, and all traffic is run off the network. If you are deploying a lot of pi&#8217;s in a area with a good physical network then this is a great option as well. This has the advantage that all the files are kept on the network and can be completely controlled from a central location.</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t be bothered to stick around and find out how I did it, you can download the script <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/eps/hpr2356/fix-ssh-on-pi.bash.txt">fix-ssh-on-pi.bash</a>. Remember that it is intended more as inspiration rather than a working tool out of the box. I deliberately wrote it so you must edit it to make it fit your needs.</p>
<p>The remainder of this post is step by step instructions that lead to the creation of the script file, with credit been given to the sites that offered each part of the solution.</p>
<h2>Download Raspian</h2>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a> and download either Raspbian Jessie with desktop, or Raspbian Jessie Lite the Minimal image.</p>
<p>You can use the tool <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha1sum"><em>sha1sum</em></a>, to confirm they are not corrupt. The sha1sums can be found on the download page. The images are regularly updated, as are the checksums and these are the values when I started researching this post. The images had already been updated by the time I posted it, proving how necessary it is to keep the changes small.</p>
<pre>$ sha1sum 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.zip | grep 82a4ecfaadbef4cfb8625f673b5f7b91c24c8e32
$ sha1sum 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie-lite.zip | grep a4b352525da188841ab53c859e61888030eb854e</pre>
<p>I use the tool <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/"><em>7z</em></a> to extract the img files. The tool is Free(dom) Software and is available in the repositories of most distributions. I like it because it is truly the one tool to deal with all the sorts of compressed formats you may come across.</p>
<pre>$ 7z x 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.zip
$ 7z x 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie-lite.zip</pre>
<p>I will also record the size of the files to compare later.</p>
<pre> $ ls -al 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie*img
 -rw-r--r--. 1 user user 4659931113 Jun 21 12:11 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img

<h2>What is a &#8220;image&#8221; file</h2>
<p>Well it is a bit by bit copy of the disk that the Rasbian Pixel developers have on their desks. That means that when you have matching checksums, you are guaranteed that every single one and zero on your sdcard is <strong>identical</strong> to the one they had on theirs. When you &#8220;burn&#8221; the image, you are taking this file, reading it and then writing it so that the order of every one and zero on your sdcard, is identical to the order on the developers sdcard.</p>
<p>What you end up with is a computer disk drive that starts with information telling the computer that it contains two different partitions, and what file systems they use. Both of these come stuffed with all the files that make up the Rasbian Pixel desktop. Have a quick look at the answer posted by <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users/9625">SG60</a> to the question <a href="https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/10442/what-is-the-boot-sequence">What is the boot sequence?</a> for a great info graphic.</p>
<p>The linux <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_(Unix)">mount</a> command has a built in option to mount these files on your computer as another disk drive. People have been <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/164227/how-to-mount-an-iso-file#193632">mounting</a> CD and DVD images for years, taking advantage of the loop option in mount.</p>
<h2>Enable sshd</h2>
<p>So according to the RaspberryPi.org article we need to add a file to the <em>/boot</em> directory called <em>ssh</em>. So to write the file we simply need to mount the filesystem so we can write to it. With the Rasbian image it&#8217;s a little bit more complicated, because unlike CD images, we do not know where the partitions start and end. There is partition information at the beginning of the sdcard but the size of this information could change on the next release. We can still mount it but we need to know the offset, or how far to skip forward, before the actual partition begins.</p>
<p>Exactly how much you need to skip forward was answered by user <a href="https://askubuntu.com/users/9340/arrange">arrange</a> in the post <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/69363/mount-single-partition-from-image-of-entire-disk-device">Mount single partition from image of entire disk (device)</a> . The approach advised was to use the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/fdisk">fdisk</a> command with the <em>&#8211;list</em> and <em>&#8211;units</em> option to get the information needed to calculate the offset.</p>
<pre>-l, --list
List the partition tables for the specified devices and then exit.
-u, --units[=unit]
When  listing  partition tables, show sizes in 'sectors' or in 'cylinders'.
</pre>
<p>To find out where the <em>/boot</em> image starts, we first need to see how many bytes are in a &#8220;Unit&#8221;. Then we need to find how many Units from the Start the partition is. In our case the units are <em>512 bytes</em>, and the Start is <em>8192</em> for the <em>/boot</em> partition which I know happens to be labeled <em>W95 FAT32 (LBA)</em>. The boot partition is usually the smallest one:</p>
<pre># fdisk --list --units 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img
Disk 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img: 4.3 GiB, 4659930624 bytes, 9101427 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = <strong>512</strong> bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x19ce0afe

Device                     Boot Start     End Sectors Size  Id Type
2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img1  <strong>8192</strong>   93486   85295 41.7M  c W95 FAT32 (LBA)
2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img2 94208 9101426 9007219  4.3G 83 Linux</pre>
<p>So to do this we need to filter for the line with <em>Units</em>, and then get the second to last column. Here we use the <a href="http://hobbypublicradio.org/series.php?id=94">awk</a> command to do both the filtering and the extraction.</p>
<pre>fdisk --list --units  "2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img" | awk '/^Units/ {print $(NF-1)}')
512
</pre>
<p>In the same way we can get the value for the <em>Start</em></p>
<pre>fdisk --list --units  "2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img" | awk '/W95 FAT32/ {print $2}' 
8192
</pre>
<p>Now we have all we need to calculate the offset in bytes.</p>
<pre># echo $((8192 * 512))
4194304
</pre>
<p>And now putting it all together we can mount the image</p>
<pre>mount -o loop,offset=4194304 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img /mnt/sdcard
</pre>
<p>We can bundle all those commands together to give us enough to mount any similar image. Have a look at the <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/series.php?id=42">Bash Series</a> on Hacker Public Radio for a detailed in-depth look at these assignments.</p>
<pre>extracted_image="2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img"
sdcard_mount="/mnt/sdcard"

echo "Mounting the sdcard boot disk"
unit_size=$(fdisk --list --units  "${extracted_image}" | awk '/^Units/ {print $(NF-1)}')
start_boot=$( fdisk --list --units  "${extracted_image}" | awk '/W95 FAT32/ {print $2}' )
offset_boot=$((${start_boot} * ${unit_size})) 
mount -o loop,offset="${offset_boot}" "${extracted_image}" "${sdcard_mount}"
</pre>
<p>We can confirm it&#8217;s mounted</p>
<pre># mount | grep sdcard
/home/user/Downloads/2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img on /mnt/sdcard type vfat (rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=ascii,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro)
</pre>
<p>And it is also available to the file system on your computer</p>
<pre># ls -al /mnt/sdcard

</pre>
<p>With the disk available to use we can easily create an empty file using a text editor. I will use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_(Unix)">touch</a> command to do this:</p>
<pre># touch /mnt/sdcard/ssh
# ls -al /mnt/sdcard/ssh
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 0 Jul 5 17:37 /mnt/sdcard/ssh
</pre>
<p>We are not finished yet but for the moment I will unmount the image using <em>umount /mnt/sdcard</em>.</p>
<p>At this point you <em>could</em> just use the image but you would be putting your system at risk. If you did you will also get a pop up warning from Rasbian to tell you how unsafe your system is. You may not be worried about anyone accessing something on the Pi, or even your network. However this computer in it&#8217;s present state can still be exploited by someone. The nasty things that they do can all be traced back to your home or business. So let&#8217;s do the right thing and configure access only via ssh-keys.</p>
<h2>ssh-keys</h2>
<p>Surprisingly this is one of the few cases where using a secure system is actually a lot more convenient than normal. With the image as it is now, you would need to type in the username pi and password Raspbian every single time you want to access the server. When we are finished you can just enter your password for your keys once, and after that you can ssh to any server without ever been presented with a login prompt !</p>
<p>Have a read of &#8220;<a href="http://www.aboutlinux.info/2005/09/how-to-setup-ssh-keys-and-why.html">How to setup SSH keys and why?</a>&#8220;, by Ravi for a nice overview.</p>
<h3>Creating ssh keys</h3>
<p>We will use the <em>ssh-keygen</em> command, and use <em>-t</em> to specify the key type, <em>-f</em> to specify where to write the file, and <em>-C</em> to add a comment. You will be asked to enter a password for the private key. Make sure this is a nice long and complicated but easy to remember one.</p>
<pre># ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ./id_ed25519 -C "Raspberry Pi keys for Ansible"
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in ./id_ed25519.
Your public key has been saved in ./id_ed25519.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:rHS3ccWV02X35Jhk5Qtfpe8VP6otTVRFNicf9Cb3S+w Raspberry Pi keys for Ansible
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|              =*^|
|             + ^X|
|             .O.@|

|      .   . o. E.|
|           .o.   |
|           ...   |
+----[SHA256]-----+
</pre>
<p>As expected this will create two files. The private key has no extension, and the public one ends with <em>.pub</em>.</p>
<pre># ls -haltr id_ed25519*
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 111 Jul 12 13:07 id_ed25519.pub
-rw-------. 1 root root 419 Jul 12 13:07 id_ed25519
</pre>
<p>You should be <strong>very</strong> careful to keep your private key secret (<em>id_ed25519</em> in our example). The other file <em>id_ed25519.pub</em> is your public key and it doesn&#8217;t matter who has access to that. For a great explanation of why it doesn&#8217;t matter I recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEBfamv-_do">this</a> video. It is stitched together from the course in <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modern-crypt/v/the-fundamental-theorem-of-arithmetic-1">Modern cryptography</a> done by Brit Cruise of the Khan Academy.</p>
<p>I have no intention of ever using these keys, so I will display their contents here.</p>
<p>The public key will be kept in a safe place and never distributed to the sdcards. Don&#8217;t forget to make a few backups.</p>
<pre># cat id_ed25519

<p>Now that you have your ssh keys ready, we are ready to copy the <strong>public</strong> key to the Rasbian image. The <strong>private</strong> key you should copy into your own <em>.ssh/</em> directory to your own home directory, on your computer.</p>
<p>The changes we now need to make are all on the same image but in the other partition. We can use the same trick we did earlier and mount the other partition. Remember that we are looking for file system type <em>Linux</em> instead of <em>W95 FAT32 (LBA)</em>. So this commands will just mount the <em>other</em> partition for us, we are using the same mount point on our own computer<em>:</em></p>
<pre>extracted_image="2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img"
sdcard_mount="/mnt/sdcard"

echo "Mounting the sdcard root disk"
unit_size=$(fdisk --list --units  "${extracted_image}" | awk '/^Units/ {print $(NF-1)}')
start_boot=$( fdisk --list --units  "${extracted_image}" | awk '/Linux/ {print $2}' )
offset_boot=$((${start_boot} * ${unit_size})) 
mount -o loop,offset="${offset_boot}" "${extracted_image}" "${sdcard_mount}"
</pre>
<p>The second partition on the sdcard is now mounted allowing us to modify it easily.</p>
<p>Normally you would use a tool called <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh-copy-id"><em>ssh-copy-id</em></a> to copy the public keys to the raspberry pi, using username and password for login. It actually creates, or adds to, a special file called <em>authorized_keys</em> in a hidden <em>.ssh</em> directory of the users home directory, with very restricted file access permissions on the directory and file level.</p>
<p>If we want to do this on the mounted image partition, we first need to create the directory, then change permissions to <a href="http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml">octal 0700</a>. This will allow the owner to, read, write, and execute (change into) the directory.</p>
<pre># mkdir /mnt/sdcard/home/pi/.ssh
# chmod 0700 /mnt/sdcard/home/pi/.ssh
# chown 1000:1000 /mnt/sdcard/home/pi/.ssh
# ls -aln /mnt/sdcard/home/pi/ | grep .ssh
drwx------. 2 1000 1000 4096 Jul 12 13:55 .ssh
</pre>
<p>Now that the directory is in place we can copy over the <strong>public</strong> key. I&#8217;m using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_%28Unix%29">cat</a> (from concatenate) command, to simulate what ssh-copy-id would do. We know the file is not there, so it will create it. If the file was there this command would add the new key to the end of it.</p>
<pre># cat id_ed25519.pub &gt;&gt; /mnt/sdcard/home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>
<p>And it is copied over.</p>
<pre># cat /mnt/sdcard/home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGiUP1V3t02ZtvJRS+1jmTBB/v5y5xH2QSNR23omAQ5N Raspberry Pi keys for Ansible
</pre>
<p>As you can imagine, ssh is very paranoid about it&#8217;s settings. All the permissions on the directory and files are checked on each login. If any are missing or have the wrong access permissions set, it will not allow you to access the system. While this may be frustrating when you are troubleshooting, just remember it is for your own good.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chown"><em>chown</em></a> command is used to change the owner of the file. You normally could use the username <strong>pi</strong>, but as we are setting this on a different computer, that user doesn&#8217;t exist. To get around this we need to use the id number for the pi user and the pi group.</p>
<pre># egrep "^pi" /mnt/sdcard/etc/passwd
pi:x:<strong>1000</strong>:1000:,,,:/home/pi:/bin/bash
# egrep "^pi" /mnt/sdcard/etc/group
pi:x:<strong>1000</strong>:</pre>
<p>As we can see that is <strong>1000</strong> in both cases, so knowing this we can fix the ownership and access permissions. This time we use <a href="http://www.perlfect.com/articles/chmod.shtml">octal 0600</a> which will not allow the file to execute. For a file, that means not allowing the file to run computer code.</p>
<pre># chown <strong>1000</strong>:<strong>1000</strong> /mnt/sdcard/home/pi/.ssh/authorized_keys

<h3>Restricting Root and Requiring Keys on the Pi&#8217;s ssh server</h3>
<p>I also want to make some changes to how the ssh server operates. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/aix/library/au-sshsecurity/index.html">Getting started with SSH security and configuration</a> is a good, if IBM specific, introduction to the topic.</p>
<p>We want to prevent any login by the user <em>root</em> over ssh, and only allow login with ssh-keys. This means changing two settings in the configuration for the ssh server that will run on the Pi itself. It&#8217;s the program that listens for connections from your PC. The man page for <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/5/sshd_config">sshd_config</a> shows us the two changes we need to make.</p>
<pre>PermitRootLogin If this option is set to no, root is not allowed to log in (via ssh).
PasswordAuthentication Specifies whether password authentication is allowed. The default is yes.</pre>
<p>We will use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed">sed</a> command below. If this doesn&#8217;t make any sense then see the complete guide to <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/series.php?id=90">sed</a> by fellow Hacker Public Radio contributor <a href="http://hackerpublicradio.org/correspondents.php?hostid=225">Dave Morriss</a>. I&#8217;m using the &#8216;<em>;</em>&#8216; as a delimiter.</p>
<pre>sed -e 's;^#PasswordAuthentication.*$;PasswordAuthentication no;g' -e 's;^PermitRootLogin .*$;PermitRootLogin no;g' -i /mnt/sdcard/etc/ssh/sshd_config
</pre>
<h3>Change root and pi user password</h3>
<p>Normally you would use <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwd">passwd</a></em> to change your password, but in our case we are directly editing the files where they are stored. Back in the day the passwords were kept in the <em>/etc/passwd</em> file. However that has long since moved to <em>/etc/shadow</em>. Here we can check the current settings for the <em>root</em> and <em>pi</em> user on the image.</p>
<pre># egrep 'root|pi' /mnt/sdcard/etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
pi:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/pi:/bin/bash
</pre>
<p>The <em>:x:</em> in the <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/understanding-etcpasswd-file-format/">second column</a> shows that the &#8220;encrypted password is stored in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwd#Shadow_file">/etc/shadow</a> file&#8221;.</p>
<pre># egrep 'root|pi' /mnt/sdcard/etc/shadow
root:*:17338:0:99999:7:::
pi:$6$hio1BNCX$Qux8hGsSy.a.pEoI/TkcGGJlEJOdCAgcTtImxDugQVO1e.6cxgsQ4pFRL2cJvn9AjCZKX4RfOgupS2gQrFhrF/:17338:0:99999:7:::
</pre>
<p>We are going to use a small python program which I found in the question &#8220;<em><a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/330069/how-to-create-an-sha-512-hashed-password-for-shadow">How to create an SHA-512 hashed password for shadow?</a></em>&#8220;. The answer by <a href="https://serverfault.com/users/5894/davey">davey</a> gives a way to do this that we can use in our script. The example password I&#8217;m using is from <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/936/">XKCD</a>, but you should use something else because the password <em>correct horse battery staple</em> is now to be found in every list of passwords to try.</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> that your hash will be different to this:</p>
<pre># root_password="$( python3 -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("correct horse battery staple", crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_SHA512)))' )"
# echo ${root_password}
$6$Fx9Jh3AIHbOYrIOd$lsrwr1d2cVl0crybGGgZZclpEcVivPhA5N8LAhHQoKOOrM.tFQV/fmWpfdGzGsJVtaaYFARk1YKt/TVfZzMCC/
</pre>
<p>We also want to change the <em>pi</em> users password, also use a different one to the one here.</p>
<pre># pi_password="$( python3 -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("wrong cart charger paperclip", crypt.mksalt(crypt.METHOD_SHA512)))' )"
# echo ${pi_password}
$6$u1n2Lx4GuxyfsEYS$FzbrDIRqXdlly191/74t8QkfQHUC.3mRwx/fu0C8J36m02PQZokEXfJGlgq2fydQ5a8s/185Mkb6MRdxWqdSF.
</pre>
<p>Now that we have assigned the passwords to two variables we can use sed with the `<em>#</em>` as a delimiter. This is because the traditional delimiter of forward slash, `<em>/</em>` is probably part of your password hash.</p>
<p>The following command will replace the existing password field for root and the user pi. That is the (the <em>:*:</em>  and the long string &#8220;<em>$6$hio1BNCX$Qux8hGsSy.a.pEoI/TkcGGJlEJOdCAgcTtImxDugQVO1e.6cxgsQ4pFRL2cJvn9AjCZKX4RfOgupS2gQrFhrF/&#8221;</em> in the <em>/etc/shadow</em> file.</p>
<pre>sed -i -e "s#^root:[^:]\+:#root:${root_password}:#" /mnt/sdcard/etc/shadow
sed -i -e "s#^pi:[^:]\+:#pi:${pi_password}:#" /mnt/sdcard/etc/shadow
</pre>
<p>And now we see they are changed</p>
<pre># egrep 'root|pi' /mnt/sdcard/etc/shadow
root:$6$Fx9Jh3AIHbOYrIOd$lsrwr1d2cVl0crybGGgZZclpEcVivPhA5N8LAhHQoKOOrM.tFQV/fmWpfdGzGsJVtaaYFARk1YKt/TVfZzMCC/:17338:0:99999:7:::
pi:$6$u1n2Lx4GuxyfsEYS$FzbrDIRqXdlly191/74t8QkfQHUC.3mRwx/fu0C8J36m02PQZokEXfJGlgq2fydQ5a8s/185Mkb6MRdxWqdSF.:17338:0:99999:7:::

<p><em><strong>WARNING</strong></em> Keep in mind that we are editing the files on the mounted sdcard and <em>not</em> the one on your own computer !!!</p>
<h2>Burn the image</h2>
<p>Now we need to unmount the image again.</p>
<pre># umount /mnt/sdcard.</pre>
<p>Just so we don&#8217;t get confused I&#8217;m going to rename both files</p>
<pre># mv -v 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie-ssh-enabled.img
'2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie.img' -&gt; '2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie-ssh-enabled.img'
# mv -v 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie-lite.img 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie-lite-ssh-enabled.img
'2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie-lite.img' -&gt; '2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie-lite-ssh-enabled.img'
</pre>
<p>Now we can see that the file size have remained the same but sha1sums have changed. This is exactly why you should always check the hash of files you download from the Internet.</p>
<pre># ls -al 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie*img
-rw-r--r--. 1 user user 1304672023 Jul 5 17:42 2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie-lite-ssh-enabled.img

</pre>
<p>You are now ready to use the modified image. To burn it you can run the <em><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsblk">lsblk</a></em> command, insert the sdcard you want to overwrite with the new image, then use <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/lsblk">lsblk</a> again to locate the new disk.</p>
<pre>        # lsblk

        <strong>mmcblk0        
</strong></pre>
<p>In my case it came up mmcblk0, which translates to <em>/dev/mmcblk0.</em> We can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)"><em>dd</em></a> command as you would <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md">normally</a>.</p>
<pre># dd bs=4M status=progress if=2017-06-21-raspbian-jessie-ssh-enabled.img of=/dev/mmcblk0</pre>
<p>Once you are finished you can put the sdcard into a Raspberry Pi and turn it on. Once you find out it&#8217;s IP Address you can ssh to it using your new keys.</p>
<pre>ssh -i id_ed25519 pi@192.168.1.5</pre>
<p>This will ask you for a password. The password is the one you set for your private ssh key above and not the password for the <em>pi</em> user. To avoid been asked every time we can simply use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-agent">ssh-agent</a> to manage our keys for us. Simply type the command <em>ssh-agent</em> and enter the password for your ssh key. If that works, you can then login without been asked for a password on any computer that has your <strong>public</strong> key listed in their <em>authorized_keys</em> file.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it &#8211; Live long and Prosper.</p>
